# MathShare
This is a step by step editor built on top of mathlive. 

Open index.html to see a list of sample problems. Clicking on one of them will take you to the editor. Debug/index.html is for being able to debug mathlive code as well as this project's code and requires a few other files.

# Acknowledgement
Benetech and its funding partners are developing this tool to benefit all kids, regardless of their abilities, to learn and do math.
